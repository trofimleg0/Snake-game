Python should be already installed.  
Recommended using version 3.7 or 3.8 to avoid conflicts and problems with pygame.

Use `pip`(or `pip3` for Python3) to install dependencies:

```commandline
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Recommended using [virtualenv/venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

## Launch ##
Run `main.py` and enjoy :)

```commandline
python3 main.py
```
